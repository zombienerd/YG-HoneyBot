CC-BY-SA-3.0 License.  You may do as you wish with this code as long as you attribute.

A discord bot for banning anyone who types in a specified channel, deleted 7 days of message history, and logging it to a 2nd channel.  This should not ban administrators or moderators that have banning ability.  

Get a discord bot token.  Make sure it has admin rights for invites.  Enable all Privileged intents Server Member & Message Content on the Bot tab. 

Paste bot token in .env.  Keep the quotes.

Ensure your server has node.js and discord.js installed. 

Run: npm install
Start with: node index.js

Invite bot to server.  From server use /bantrap set to set the trap channel.  Use /bantrap setlog to set the log channel.

Done.  Should just work.  This code is offered with no support, so if things go wrong, try google first, or ask your favorite LLM.
